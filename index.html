        <p class="subtitle">British Skydiving needs to cut costs, not raise fees.</p>

        <div class="cta">
            <p><strong>Vote no to the membership fee increase.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Every year, British Skydiving increases membership fees. CEO Rob offers cursory explanations at best. The organisation has become bloated and unresponsive to its members and drop zones.</p>

        <p>Drop zones bear the brunt of this, especially through the per-tandem fee. Those costs are passed on, making skydiving more expensive for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Staff Are Expensive</h2>
        <div class="stats">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Organisation</th>
                    <th>Members</th>
                    <th>Staff</th>
                    <th>Ratio</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Canadian Parachute Assoc.</td>
                    <td>~3,000</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>1:1,500</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>USPA (USA)</td>
                    <td>~40,000</td>
                    <td>~20</td>
                    <td>1:2,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="highlight">
                    <td><strong>British Skydiving</strong></td>
                    <td>~4,500</td>
                    <td>13 (hiring 2 more)</td>
                    <td>1:300</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>British Skydiving employs one staff member for every 300 members. The USPA manages with one per 2,000. The Canadians run their entire operation with just two people.</p>

        <p>And yet British Skydiving is recruiting more staff, including a "Safety and Insight Analyst" to join the existing FOUR safety staff. Meanwhile, money flows to vanity projects like the Ambassador Programme.</p>

        <p>Many not-for-profit organisations set executive pay based on organisational size and turnover. This creates a perverse incentive: it's hard to motivate a CEO to shrink an organisation when their salary depends on it staying big.</p>

        <h2>What's At Stake</h2>
        <p>Major drop zones are already exploring forming their own organisation. If that happens, British Skydiving loses a massive chunk of its revenue overnight. At that point, fees will either skyrocket or drastic cuts will be forced upon them.</p>

        <p>It would be far better if British Skydiving pre-emptively met the needs of drop zones and members, rather than waiting for a crisis.</p>

        <div class="cta">
            <h2>Vote No at the AGM</h2>
            <p>Send a clear message: British Skydiving cannot take its members or drop zones for granted. Vote against the membership fee increase.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What Next?</h2>
        <p>Financially, a single vote won't make much difference - but hopefully it acts as an important symbolic vote to an organisation that isn't used to hearing 'No'</p>
        <p>Josh, Gareth and Noel both campaigned to be elected on the basis that BS has become distant from its members and dropzones. Hopefully they will all be elected - and can point to this vote as evidence that BS needs to take them seriously</p>
        <p>I would like to see British Skydiving take a hard look at its cost structure and dramatically reduce the activities it performs and the costs it incurs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dramatically cut staff costs</li>
            <li>Pass savings on to drop zones through reduced tandem fees</li>
            <li>Reduce membership fees for individuals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Drastic action is needed to make British Skydiving sustainable and fit for purpose.</p>
        <p>Ultimately - if they do nothing, then my plan is to bring a special resolution next year which requires them to act</p>
